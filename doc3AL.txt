Here is another brand new file for github practice. 

Mariela says make commits separately by topic. This is so you can easily move backwards in time if you need to. 

If I publish this local repo to github, I can continue making changes to local repo. 
Then I can push to origin, which will push local changes to master stored on github server. 

If i make changes in origin master, or if a collaborator makes changes, I will see a fetch button on desk top.
