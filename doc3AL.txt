Here is another brand new file for github practice. 

Mariela says make commits separately by topic. This is so you can easily move backwards in time if you need to. 

If I publish this local repo to github, I can continue making changes to local repo. 
Then I can push to origin, which will push local changes to master stored on github server. 

If i make changes in origin master, or if a collaborator makes changes, I will see a fetch button on desk top. 

If you make conflicting changes in files with a collaborator, you will get some error messages that I have saved in doc2AL. 
HEAD;   this marks where the changes started. 
long string of numbers: this tells you exactly where the error occured. 

Pull request: this makes a copy of someone else's code for yourself. 
If you want to play around with the code and maybe merge back with original, FORK it.
Once you have the fork, click clone. Clone will put repository on your local computer and your own github repository.
If you just download a repo without forking, you can make local changes, but you can't push them back to the original.
